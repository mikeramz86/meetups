Types of Applications

What are our goals
1. developer eperience
    two conflicting desires:
        1. split task among a team
        2. Allow for full slices with relative ease (path to quick mvp)
2. Scalability
    1. OVer time (maintanability)
    2. OVer processing power (Sinle user performance)
    Over network infrastructure (multi user performance)

Solutions:
- Serialie and deserialize
    - go vertical and then horizontal
- Seriaazing Interfaces

Bad: Organization by Technology
- Unclear how many Technologie sare necessary for the entire system to work for a single data Collection
- difficult to find a ll loose ends for a single data collection, spread, across many folders

Good: Organization by Domain

Bad: Rest
- poorly defined Interfaces
- hard/lengthy to build quality Interfaces
good: graphql
- great definition of Interfaces
    - docs write themselves
initial length but more features
    - one endpoint
    - c
